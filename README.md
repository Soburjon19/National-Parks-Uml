## Description
UML, which stands for Unified Modeling Language, is a way to visually represent the architecture, design, and implementation of complex software systems. When you're writing code, there are thousands of lines in an application, and it's challenging to keep track of the relationships and hierarchies within a software system. UML diagrams divide that software system into components and subcomponents.
